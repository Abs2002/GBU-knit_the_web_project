                The National Capital Region (NCR) is a planning region centred upon the National 
                Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi in India. It encompasses Delhi and several dist
                -ricts surrounding it from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
                The NCR and the associated National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) were
                created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve harmonized 
                policies for the control of land-uses and development of infrastructure in the 
                region.Prominent cities of NCR include Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, 
                and Noida.
                
                The NCR is a rural-urban region, with a population of over 46,069,000 and an 
                urbanisation level of 62.6%.As well as the cities and towns, the NCR contains
                ecologically sensitive areas like the Aravalli ridge, forests, wildlife and 
                bird sanctuaries. The Delhi Extended Urban Agglomeration, a part of the NCR, 
                had an estimated GDP of $370 billion (measured in terms of GDP PPP) in 2015-16.

                The National Capital Region (NCR) and its planning board were created under the
                National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985.That 1985 Act defined the
                NCR as being the whole of Delhi; the Haryana districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad and
                Sonipat, Rohtak (then including Jhajjar tehsil) and the Rewari tehsil then in 
                Mahendragarh district; and the Uttar Pradesh districts of Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar, 
                Meerut (then including Baghpat tehsil), and Ghaziabad (then including Hapur tehsil),
                and some part of the Rajasthan district of Alwar. The 1985 boundary of the NCR
                covered an area of 34,144 square kilometres (13,183 sq mi).
                
                Prior to the creation of the NCR, an area described as the Delhi Metropolitan Area 
                (DMA) was described in the 1962 Master Plan for Delhi. That plan defined the DMA as
                comprising the National Capital Territory and the ring towns of Ghaziabad, Faridabad,
                Ballabhgarh, Gurgaon, Bahadurgarh and Loni, also certain rural areas, which had a 
                population of the somewhat less than 2.1 million in 1951.[8] The following "Master 
                Plan for Delhi", approved in August 1990, added Noida, Bahadurgarh and the then-
                proposed township of Kundli to the DMA, which consequently covered an area of 
                3,182 km2.

                Gautam Budh Nagar district was created in 1997 out of the existing NCR districts of 
                Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr. The city of Noida was the location of the new district's
                headquarters. Also in 1997 Baghpat district was created from Baghpat tehsil of 
                Meerut district.

                In July 2013, the NCR was expanded to include three more districts, Bhiwani, and Ma-
                -hendragarh in the state of Haryana, as well as Bharatpur in the state of Rajasthan.
                This brought the number of districts in the NCR to 19 (outside Delhi NCT), with the 
                total NCR area increasing 34% to 45,887 km2. Subsequently, Charkhi Dadri district 
                was separated from Bhiwani district in 2016.

                On 9 June 2015, the Government of India approved the inclusion of three more distr-
                -icts in NCR -Jind, Panipat, Karnal in the state of Haryana and Muzaffarnagar in 
                Uttar Pradesh.[15][16][17][18] covering a total area of 50,566 km2. Shamli district
                of U.P. was added to the NCR in December 2017.[20] As of 2021, there are a total of
                24 districts in the NCR, excluding the 11 districts of Delhi.
